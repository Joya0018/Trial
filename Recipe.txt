Recipe

Ingredients:

8 ounces (about 225g) of pasta (spaghetti, penne, or your choice)
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 can (14 ounces / 400g) diced tomatoes
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
Salt and pepper to taste
Grated Parmesan cheese for serving (optional)
Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)
Instructions:

Cook the Pasta:

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.
Once cooked, drain the pasta and set aside.
Prepare the Sauce:

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
Add the minced garlic and chopped onion to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent and the garlic is fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.
Add the Tomatoes and Seasonings:

Stir in the diced tomatoes, dried basil, and dried oregano.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly and the flavors meld together.
Combine Pasta and Sauce:

Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the tomato sauce.
Toss the pasta in the sauce until it is well coated and heated through, about 1-2 minutes.
Serve:

Divide the pasta among serving plates or bowls.
If desired, sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on top.
Garnish with fresh basil leaves for extra flavor and color.
Serve hot and enjoy!
